BookDiary is a personal Android application that allows users to manage their reading habits. You can add books, track reading sessions, and view detailed information about your library — all in a clean, multilingual interface.

This project was developed as part of a university assignment, but it’s also something I’ve wanted to build for a long time as a personal reading tracker.

## ✨ Features

- 📖 Add, view, edit, and delete books from your personal library  
- 🕒 Track reading sessions linked to each book  
- 🌍 Multilingual interface: English (default), Spanish, and Finnish  
- 📸 Optional book cover images using Glide  
- 🗑️ Settings screen with a "Clear all data" option  
- 🔄 Dynamic navigation using Fragments and Room for local persistence

---

## 🚧 Known Issues

- Rotating the screen while in the library view may occasionally cause a crash due to fragment state issues.
- Finnish translation was generated using AI (ChatGPT), so minor language inaccuracies are possible.

## 📦 APK & Installation

You can download and install the .apk directly (Make sure to allow installation from unknown sources on your device)

Alternatively, you can build it yourself:

1. Clone this repo  
2. Open with Android Studio  
3. Run on an emulator or physical device

## 📄 AI Use Statement

I used ChatGPT to:
- Correct the grammar of the learning diary
- Translate app text into Finnish
- Understand and debug isolated issues

All code, architecture, and design decisions were made independently. This project is entirely my own work and reflects something I’ve been wanting to build for a while.
